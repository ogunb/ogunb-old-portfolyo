# This is the source files for my personal website.
It still has some bugs, work arounds I should fix, but it's mostly finished; like 99% finished.

I had fun building it and now you can have it, modify it, share it; use it however you like.
Since it was just a side project, I didn't use any comments on the files so it may not be beginner friendly.

And again, you can make it your own if you want and if you can.

Have fun!
